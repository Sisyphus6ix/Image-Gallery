# Image-Gallery

This is going to be a simple webpage that shows images of a small portion of my favorite athletes and iconic moments in each of their respective careers.

This webpage will be using basic HTML as well as Flexbox and CSS3 for styling. The motivation behind this project was to help me get a better understanding of these features.

P.S. If you do not like any of these players no hard feelings :)
